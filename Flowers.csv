FLOWER,BOTANICAL NAME,DESCRIPTION,OPENING,CLOSING
Yellow Goats Beard,Tragopogon pratensis,"This aster-family weed and biennial plant is a low-growing rosette during the first year. Each stem is round, hairless, and often somewhat enlarged at the base of each leaf. The cauline leaves alternate sparingly and become smaller as they ascend the stems. The adventive Yellow Goat's Beard is common in central and northern Illinois, but occasional or absent in the southern section of the state. It is native to Eurasia. Habitats include mesic black soil prairies, weedy meadows near woodlands, areas along roads and railroads, vacant lots, and miscellaneous waste areas. Disturbed areas are preferred, although this plant can be found occasionally in prairie remnants along railroads.",03:00 AM,12:00 PM
Rough Hawkbit,Leontodon hispidus ,"Rough hawkbit is a short, grassland perennial with a very hairy stem that swells slightly at the top. The solitary flowers, which are in bloom from late May to October, are a rich golden yellow with the outer florets often reddish or orange and the bracts behind the flower appearing very shaggy. The leaves which make up the basal rosette are long and bluntly lobed. ",04:00 AM,05:00 PM
Narrow Leaf Hawksbeard,Crepis tectorum,"Narrowleaf hawksbeard’s original stand in Finland is native to nutritious rocky outcrops, bird rocks and meadows, but the alien stand which thrives close to people is much more common. It probably originally became common through cereal cultivation – it can still be seen now and then growing in fields as a weed – but it is more common in fallow fields and beside roads. In particular it thrives around inhabited areas which people have made more fertile. In an urban environment the species has made use of open, dry places in railway yards, industrial and storage areas, waste ground and cracks in the pavement. It used to even grow on lichenous turf and shingle roofs. Narrowleaf hawksbeard’s capitula open soon after sunrise but they close before noon.",04:00 AM,12:00 PM
Sow Thistle,Sonchus oleraceus,"The Sow-Thistle is a well-known weed in every field and garden. It is a perennial, growing from 1 to 3 feet high, with hollow thick, branched stems full of milky juice, and thin, oblong leaves, more or less cut into (pinnatifid) with irregular, prickly teeth on the margins. The upper leaves are much simpler in form than the lower ones, clasping the stem at their bases. The flowers are a pale yellow, and when withered, the involucres close over them in a conical form. The seed vessels are crowned with a tuft of hairs, or pappus, like most of this large family of Compositae. This plant is subject to great variations, which are merely owing to soil and situation, some being more prickly than others. ",05:00 AM,12:00 PM
Dandelion,Taraxacum officinale Weber,"The Dandelion though not occurring in the Southern Hemisphere, is at home in all parts of the north temperate zone, in pastures, meadows and on waste ground, and is so plentiful that farmers everywhere find it a troublesome weed, for though its flowers are more conspicuous in the earlier months of the summer, it may be found in bloom, and consequently also prolifically dispersing its seeds, almost throughout the year. From its thick tap root, dark brown, almost black on the outside though white and milky within, the long jagged leaves rise directly, radiating from it to form a rosette Iying close upon the ground.",05:00 AM,09:00 AM
Hawksbeard,Crepis alpina,"Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that Crepis usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name Crepis derives from the greek word ""krepis"", meaning ""slipper"" or ""sandal"", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit. It is distributed throughout the Norther Hemisphere and Africa and several plants are known as introduced species worldwide. The center of diversity is in the Mediterranean.",05:00 AM,11:00 AM
False Sow Thistle,Reichardia tingitana,"False Sow-thistle belongs to a group of mainly yellow-flowered daisies in the Tribe Lactuceae. The plants in this tribe are characterised by having a basal rosette of leaves (flat-weeds), milky sap in their stems and their flower-heads consisting entirely of ray florets (i.e. no ‘eye’ to the daisy). It is an annual to perennial tap-rooted herb with fleshy and hairless leaves with minutely prickly margins. Basal leaves oblanceolate (lance-shaped with the narrowend attached to the stem). The flowers are yellow with a purplish base and the outer petals red-striped. Their habitat is scattered on coastal sand dunes and on sandy soils in the far north-west of Victoria.",06:00 AM,10:00 AM
Spotted Cats Ear,Hypochaeris maculata,"Spotted cat’s ear’s large capitula make it a very attractive and eye-catching ornamental plant. In bygone times the appearance of its yellow capitula on meadows meant the beginning of hay-work in agricultural communities. Apart from being a calendar plant, spotted cat’s ear also served as a clock: hay-work began at 6 a.m., the same time as the plant opens its capitulum – and it was time to return home for dinner when it closed up again at 4 or 5 pm. Nowadays of course an adjustment must be made for summer time, which is an hour ahead. Spotted cat’s ear has been useful in more concrete ways too: the leaf can be boiled like cabbage and the roots and capitulum make a good general tonic.",06:00 AM,05:00 PM
Canadian Hawkweed,Hieracium umbellatum ,"Canadadian Hawkweed is an erect native perennial growing to 5' in height on stems that are smooth and unbranched below the inflorescence. Within the inflorescence the stem is green to greenish-red and is rough. Stems contain a milky juice. The leaves are alternate and located on the stem below the inflorescence. They are lanceolate to elliptical, stalkless; tips are pointed. The margins usually have small sharply pointed teeth, but irregularly spaced, sometimes giving the appearance of small lobes. The upper surface is a greenish gray, smooth, while the lower surface can be hairy and rough. Leaf edges do not have hair. Canada Hawkweed and related species grow in dry areas of woods, thickets, prairies, in more sandy type soils with mesic to dry moisture conditions, in full sun.",06:00 AM,05:00 PM
Marsh Sow Thistle,Sonchus palustris,"The Marsh Sow-Thistle is a much taller species than either of the preceding, attaining a height of 6 to 8 feet, being one of the tallest of our English herbaceous plants. The root is perennial, fleshy and branched, but not creeping; the leaves, arrow-shaped at the base, large, shiny on the under surfaces; the flowers, large and pale yellow, with hairy involucres, are in bloom in September and October, much later than the last species, which it somewhat resembles, though the edges of the leaves are minutely toothed, not waved. It grows in marshy places but is rare in this country, being now extinct in most of the places in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Essex where it was formerly found, and only occurring on the Thames below Woolwich. This thistle was placed by mediaeval botanists under the planetary influences of Mars: 'Mars rules it, it is such a prickly business.'",07:00 AM,02:00 PM
Blue Sow Thistle,Cicerbita alpina,"Cicerbita alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Sow-thistle or Alpine Blue-sow-thistle is a perennial herbaceous plant sometimes placed in the genus Cicerbita of the Asteraceae family and sometimes place in the genus Lactuca as Lactuca alpina. Cicerbita alpina grows on many mountains of Europe (e.g. the Apls, the Pyrenees, the northern Apennines, the Scandinavian Peninsula, Scotland, the Carpathians, Romania and the Urals.These plants can be found in alpine woods, besides streams, in rich-soil in hollows and in tall meadows, usually between 1,000 and 1,800 metres (3,300 and 5,900 ft) above sea level.",07:00 AM,12:00 PM
Garden Lettuce,Lactuca sativa,"Lettuce is an annual plant of the daisy family Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds. Lettuce was first cultivated by the ancient Egyptians who turned it from a weed, whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves, in addition to its oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name lactuca from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, multiple types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals.Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.",07:00 AM,10:00 AM
White Waterlily,Nymphaea alba,"Nymphaea alba, also known as the European white water-lily, white water rose or white nenuphar, is an aquatic flowering plant of the family Nymphaecaeae. It grows in water that is 30 to 50  cm (12 to 9  in) deep and likes large ponds and lakes. The leaves can be up to 30  cm (12  inches) in diameter and they take up a spread of 150  cm (59  in) per plant. The flowers are white and they have many small stamens inside. It is found all over Europe and in parts of North Africa and the Middle East in freshwater. The red variety (Nymphaea alba f. rosea) which is in cultivation came from lake Fair Tarn in the forest of Tiveden, Sweden, where they were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery led to a large scale exploitation which nearly made it extinct in the wild before it was protected.",07:00 AM,05:00 PM
Scarlet Pimpernel,Anagallis arvensis,"Scarlet pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis; also known as red pimpernel, red chickweed, poorman's barometer, poor man's weather-glass, shepherd's weather glass or shepherd's clock because it flowers from 8 am to 4-5 pm) is a low-growing annual plant. The native range of the species is Europe and Western Asia and North Africa. The species has been distributed widely by humans, either deliberately as an ornamental flower or accidentally. A. arvensis is now naturalised almost worldwide. This common european plant is generally considered a weed and is an indicator of light soils, though it grows opportunistically in clavey soils as well.",08:00 AM,05:00 PM
Ice Plant,Mesembryanthemum crystallinum,"The ice-plant is a prostrate succulent plant native to Africa, Sinai and Southern Europe and naturalized in North America, South America and Australia. The plant is covered with large, glistening bladder cells or water vesicles, reflected in its common names of common iceplant, crystalline iceplant or ice plant. It can be annual, biennial or perennial, but its life cycle is usually completed within several months, depending on environmental conditions. It is found on a wide range of soil types, from well-drained sandy soils (including sand dunes), to loamy and clay soils. It can tolerate nutritionally poor or saline soils. As with many introduced species it also grows in disturbed sites such as roadsides, rubbish dumps and homestead yards. The ice-plant flowers from spring to early summer. Flowers open in the morning and close at night and are insect pollinated.",09:00 AM,09:00 PM
Quill Fameflower,Phemeranthus teretifolius,"Quill fameflower is a member of the Portulacaceae, the Purslane family. This family includes spring beauty, montia, and the weedy introduced purslane among others. Many of the species in the family are succulent or fleshy, adapted for arid or saline environments. In older manuals, this species is called Talinum teretifolium Pursh. Sixteen species of fameflower are recognized in North America, most from the southwest or plains states. Phemeranthus means ephemeral flower in reference to the short life of each flower.The flowers open about 3 pm EDT and close before sunset, lasting only one day. A single large plant may produce one hundred or so flowers.",03:00 PM,07:00 PM
Sundrops,Oenothera fruticosa,"Oenothera fruticosa, commonly called sundrops or southern sundrop, is an erect, day-flowering member of the evening primrose family. This native typically grows 15-30” tall and produces terminal clusters of bright yellow four-petaled flowers on stems clad with lanceolate green leaves. Flowers are followed by distinctive club-shaped seed capsules. Each flower is short-lived, but flowers bloom in succession over a fairly long period of two months. The beauty of this variety is its evergreen reddish color in winter.",06:00 PM,04:00 AM
